# Surf's Up Weather Analysis

### **Overview of the Surf's Up Weather Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, from a dataset provided by W. Avy.

The findings of this analysis are discussed within the "Results" section below.


### **Results**

The results of this analysis are summarized in in *Figure 1* and *Figure 2*.

**_Figure 2_:** December Summary Statistics

 * **June Summary Statistics:**
  	* Per *Figure 1*  the mean temperature for June is 74.9 Degrees. Minimum temperature is 64.0 and maximum temperature is 85 Degrees. Standard Deviation is 3.257.
  
 * **December Summary Statistics:**
  	* Per *Figure 2*  the mean temperature for December is 71.04 Degrees. Minimum temperature is 56.0 and maximum temperature is 83 Degrees. Standard Deviation is 3.75.

 * **June vs. December Comparision:**
  	* June has a warmer average temperature than December (74.9 vs. 71.04)
  	* June shows lesser variance in its sample set, with a lower standard deviation than the December dataset (3.257 vs. 3.75)
  	* December shows a larger variability between its min and max temperatures (27 = 83-56) vs June (21 = 85-64).
 

### **Surfs Up Weather Analysis Summary**

1. June has an overall higher mean temperature with lesser variability than the December dataset. Full details are provided in Results, above.

2. Additional investigations can be conducted to better assess the operability of this business. Two further query suggestions are as follows:

	**Precipiation Analysis:**
Tourists may choose to visit for reasons other than surfing. Excess precipitation may be a deterrent for visitors. Seasonal preciptiation analysis should be conducted to assess the months of higher rainfall. Foot traffic, and thus business decisions may be estimated based on this.

	**Variability Among Weather Stations:**
It may be useful to assess the summary statistics per weather station, for each month to assess any consistent variabilities between the weather stations. Depending on the station's location or altitude, the results may be affected (e.g. areas near ocean may be colder due to thermal mass of water, areas at higher altitudes may also be colder due to lower air pressure). These are important considerations, since the area of location for the shop is based upon these, the data should accurately reflect that specific location.
